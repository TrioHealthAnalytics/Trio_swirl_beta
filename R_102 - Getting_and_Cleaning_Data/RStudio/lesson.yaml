  Output: I've created a variable for you called path_to_lesson_data. You can probably guess what it contains. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Confirm what is in the variable path_to_lesson_data
  CorrectAnswer: "path_to_lesson_data"
  AnswerTests: omnitest("path_to_lesson_data")
  Hint: Just type "path_to_lesson_data" in the console.

  Output: As you can see, this is a very complex path and it is specific to your own machine. This can make sharing your work very difficult. 

- Class : text
  Output: If you were to have this as your working directory, anyone trying to run your R script on their own machine would need to make sure all the working directories are in order before they could run your R script. 
  
- Class : text
  Output: This can be a very difficult task if you have a lot of source files. Thankfully, RStudio Projects make R scripts agnostic to where it's located.

  Output: Unfortunately, swirl doesn't provide a good way to demonstrate RStudio Project functionality. Here are a couple good resources though.
